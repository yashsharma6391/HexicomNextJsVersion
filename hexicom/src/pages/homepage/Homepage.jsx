        <h1 data-aos="fade-up">Company Overview</h1>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" className={styles.AboutCompanyPara}>
          Incorporated in 2025, our company represents the culmination of nearly
          two decades of industry experience, visionary leadership, and a
          relentless pursuit of excellence. Founded by Mr. Dheeraj Sharma, a
          seasoned professional with over 15 years of hands-on expertise across
          India's service ecosystem, the company brings a new energy to the
          fields and industry of SITC in sectors of IT & Telecom Infrastructure,
          Electrical and Automation, EV Charging Stations , Networking,
          Logistics, Solar EPC, Repair & Refurbishment, Optical Fibre Networks,
          Electro-Mechanical Civil Works, and Satcom Technologies. Mr. Sharma
          began his professional journey in 2010, stepping into the industry as
          a Director in a prominent organization. Over the years, he went on to
          play instrumental roles in multiple companies, leading critical
          projects, building cross-functional teams, and shaping strategic
          roadmaps that delivered measurable impact across both government and
          private sectors. His leadership journey has been defined by an ability
          to balance technical insight with business acumen — a rare combination
          that enabled him to transform challenges into scalable, sustainable
          solutions. Driven by a vision to create something larger than himself,
          and inspired by the lessons of nearly two decades in the service
          sector, Mr. Sharma laid the foundation for this new venture in 2025.
          This company is more than just a business entity — it is the
          embodiment of a proven track record, deep-rooted industry knowledge,
          and a passion for delivering value through innovation, discipline, and
          execution excellence. We have positioned ourselves as a multi-domain
          service provider, offering integrated solutions that span from design
          and deployment to operations and optimization. With capabilities that
          cut across sectors and functions, we are structured to support
          large-scale infrastructure projects as well as agile,
          technology-driven initiatives — all with a focus on client
          satisfaction and long-term value creation. What sets us apart is not
          just what we do, but how we do it. We believe in bringing together the
          best of people, processes, and performance. Our team is made up of
          professionals who are not only technically skilled but are also
          aligned with our core values of Trust, Respect, and Accountability —
          principles that guide every decision, every project, and every
          relationship we build. With a leadership team that understands the
          nuances of business development, strategic alliances, project
          execution, and market expansion, we are well-equipped to drive
          innovation and deliver results in an ever-evolving business landscape.
          Our approach is rooted in clarity of vision, depth of expertise, and a
          relentless focus on quality — all of which allow us to navigate
          complex environments with confidence. As a new company with a legacy
          of experience, we are committed to growing responsibly, building
          strong partnerships, and continuously raising the bar of excellence in
          everything we do. Our goal is not just to participate in the market —
          but to transform it, one successful project at a time.
